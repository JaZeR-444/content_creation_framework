# START HERE

Welcome to the Content Creation Framework System!

## Quick Start Guide

This framework provides a complete, structured system for planning, creating, optimizing, and analyzing content at scale.

### First-Time Setup

1. **Read this file first** - You're in the right place
2. **Review the OVERVIEW.md** - Understand the big picture
3. **Check Conventions.md** - Learn the naming and organizational standards
4. **Use the Folder-Index.md** - Navigate to specific phases
5. **Start with Phase 01** - Strategy and Planning is your foundation

### How to Use This Framework

#### For New Content Creators:
- Begin with `01_Strategy_and_Planning/`
- Work through each phase sequentially (01 → 02 → 03 → 04 → 05 → 06)
- Optional: You can treat phases 05–06 as advanced and revisit them later
- Use the User-Input-Forms to capture your specific information
- Follow the Master Files in each phase for comprehensive guidance

#### For Experienced Creators:
- Jump to the phase most relevant to your current needs
- Use Templates/ for quick-start documents
- Reference the GLOSSARY.md for term definitions
- Track your content using Content-ID-Map.csv
