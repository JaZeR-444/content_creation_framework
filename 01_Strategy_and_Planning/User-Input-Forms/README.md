# User Input Forms - Strategy and Planning

## Purpose

This folder contains user input forms for each of the 10 prompts in the Strategy and Planning phase. These forms help you capture the specific information needed to customize each prompt with your unique business context, goals, and audience details.

## What's Inside

Each form corresponds to a numbered prompt in the parent folder:

1. **001_Positioning-Statement_Inputs.md** - Your brand, audience, problem, and promise
2. **002_90-Day-Plan_Inputs.md** - Goals, metrics, and action steps
3. **003_Ideal-Viewer-Profile_Inputs.md** - Detailed audience demographics and psychographics
4. **004_Content-Pillars_Inputs.md** - Core topics and themes
5. **005_Idea-Backlog_Inputs.md** - Content ideas and priorities
6. **006_Publishing-Cadence_Inputs.md** - Schedule and capacity planning
7. **007_Competitor-Scan_Inputs.md** - Competitor analysis data
8. **008_Brand-One-Pager_Inputs.md** - Brand identity details
9. **009_6-Week-Content-Calendar_Inputs.md** - Content calendar specifics
10. **010_Seed-Keyword-List-50-Terms-and-Questions_Inputs.md** - SEO keyword research

## How to Use These Forms

### Step 1: Read the Prompt
First, open the corresponding prompt file in the parent folder (e.g., `001_Positioning-Statement-Prompt_2025-11-06.txt`)

### Step 2: Fill Out the Input Form
Open the matching input form and answer all questions thoroughly. The more specific you are, the better your outputs will be.

### Step 3: Use Your Inputs
Copy your completed input information and use it when working through the prompt with an AI assistant or during your own planning sessions.

### Step 4: Save Your Work
Keep your completed input forms. You'll reference them throughout your content creation journey and update them as your strategy evolves.

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific** - Generic inputs lead to generic outputs. Provide details, examples, and context.

2. **Be Honest** - Accurately assess your current situation, resources, and constraints.

3. **Update Regularly** - Revisit these forms quarterly or when major changes occur in your business or audience.

4. **Cross-Reference** - Your inputs should be consistent across forms (e.g., your ideal viewer from form 003 should align with your positioning from form 001).

5. **Save Versions** - Keep dated versions of your input forms to track how your strategy evolves.

## Integration with Master File

The Strategy-and-Planning-Master-File.md in the parent folder provides comprehensive context for all 10 prompts. Use it alongside these input forms for the complete picture.

## Tips for Success

- **Set aside focused time** - Don't rush through these forms. Strategic planning requires deep thinking.
- **Involve your team** - Get input from collaborators, team members, or trusted advisors.
- **Research first** - Do your homework before filling out forms (especially competitor scan and keyword research).
- **Think long-term** - While you're planning for 90 days, consider how these decisions fit into your long-term vision.

## Next Steps

After completing all input forms:
1. Review for consistency and completeness
2. Share with team members for feedback
3. Use as foundation for Phase 02 (Content Creation and Production)
4. Reference when making strategic decisions
5. Update as you learn from Phase 04 (Analysis and Iteration)
