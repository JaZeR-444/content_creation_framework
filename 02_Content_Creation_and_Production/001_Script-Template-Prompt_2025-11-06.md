You are an expert content strategist. Your task is to create a reusable script template that ensures a compelling narrative structure for video content. The template should guide the user through crafting a script with a clear hook, setup, a series of narrative beats, a satisfying payoff, and a strong call to action (CTA).

**Instructions:**

1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** Analyze the user's primary goal for the video. Is it to educate, entertain, persuade, or a combination? The script's focus will shift based on this goal.
2.  **Outline the Script Sections:** Create a template with the following sections:
    *   **Hook (0-15 seconds):** The opening that grabs the viewer's attention.
        *   **Prompt:** "What is the single most compelling question, surprising statement, or intriguing visual you can use to stop the scroll and get your ideal viewer to pay attention?"
    *   **Setup (15-45 seconds):** Introduce the core premise, the characters (if any), and the stakes. Establish the "before" state.
        *   **Prompt:** "Briefly introduce the main topic or problem. What essential context does the viewer need to understand the story? What is the status quo or the initial challenge?"
    *   **Beats (1-3 minutes):** The sequence of events or points that build the narrative. This is the "during" state, where the transformation or journey happens. Each beat should logically follow the previous one.
        *   **Prompt:** "Outline 3-5 key 'beats' or steps in your story. Each beat should build on the last, raising the stakes or deepening the viewer's understanding. What are the key moments of discovery, conflict, or progress?"
    *   **Payoff (30-60 seconds):** The resolution of the setup. This is the "after" state, where the problem is solved, the question is answered, or the transformation is complete.
        *   **prompt:** "What is the ultimate resolution or key takeaway? How has the initial situation changed? Deliver the promised value and provide a sense of closure."
    *   **Call to Action (CTA) (15-30 seconds):** Guide the viewer on what to do next.
        *   **Prompt:** "What is the single most important action you want the viewer to take after watching? Make it clear, direct, and easy to follow. (e.g., 'Subscribe for more...', 'Download the guide...', 'Leave a comment with your thoughts...')"

**Example Template:**

**Video Goal:** [e.g., To teach viewers how to make a perfect omelette]

*   **Hook:** "You've been making omelettes wrong your whole life. Here are three common mistakes and how to fix them for good."
*   **Setup:** "A perfect omelette is fluffy, evenly cooked, and never rubbery. But getting it right is tricky. We'll start with the basics: the right pan, the right heat, and the right ingredients."
*   **Beats:**
    1.  **Beat 1: The Pan & Heat:** "Mistake #1: Using a sticky pan. You need a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Not high heat!"
    2.  **Beat 2: The Eggs:** "Mistake #2: Over-beating the eggs. Whisk them just until the yolks and whites are combined. We want texture, not foam."
    3.  **Beat 3: The Technique:** "Mistake #3: The frantic scramble. I'll show you the gentle 'push and pull' method for creamy curds."
*   **Payoff:** "And there you have it. A perfect, restaurant-quality omelette. No more rubbery, overcooked eggs. Just a delicious, fluffy breakfast every time."
*   **CTA:** "If you want to master more classic cooking techniques, subscribe for our weekly videos. And let me know in the comments what you want to learn next!"

**Your Task:**

Now, use this framework to create a script template for your own video idea. Fill in the prompts for each section.
