# 02_Content_Creation_and_Production

This phase guides you through the practical aspects of content creation and production, ensuring consistency, quality, and efficiency in your workflow.

## Overview

Content Creation and Production contains 10 essential modules for building repeatable production systems:

1. **Script Template** - Structure video content with hooks, beats, and CTAs
2. **Pre-Production Checklist** - Plan outlines, shot lists, props, and locations
3. **Standardize Gear Setup** - Ensure consistent mic, lighting, and camera settings
4. **Define Recording Ritual** - Create repeatable on-set workflows
5. **Folder Structure and Naming** - Organize project files systematically
6. **Document Editing Workflow** - Build repeatable post-production processes
7. **Save Presets** - Standardize transitions, LUTs, and export settings
8. **Thumbnail Template Set** - Create reusable thumbnail layouts
9. **End Screen and Card Template** - Design templates for engagement
10. **Backup Plan (3-2-1)** - Protect your work with proper backup systems

## How to Use This Phase

1. **Review the Master File**: Check `Content-Creation-and-Production_Master-File.md` for the complete production workflow
2. **Set Up Systems First**: Start with infrastructure modules (003-007) before diving into content creation
3. **Use Input Forms**: Fill out the forms in `User-Input-Forms/` to customize each module to your needs
4. **Build Once, Use Forever**: These systems save time on every future project

## Files in This Folder

- **Individual Prompt Files** (001-010): Detailed prompts for each production module
- **Master Files** (.md and .txt): Combined reference documents with all 10 modules
- **User-Input-Forms/**: Structured templates for your production setup

## Success Criteria

You've completed this phase when you have:
- A standardized gear setup documented
- Repeatable editing workflow with saved presets
- Consistent folder structure and naming conventions
- Thumbnail and end screen templates ready to use
- A tested backup and recovery plan in place

## Next Steps

With production systems in place, move to **03_Optimization_and_Distribution** to ensure your content reaches and resonates with your audience.
