# User Input Forms - Content Creation and Production

## Purpose

This folder contains user input forms for each of the 10 prompts in the Content Creation and Production phase. These forms help you document your production processes, equipment, workflows, and standards to ensure consistent, high-quality content creation.

## What's Inside

Each form corresponds to a numbered prompt in the parent folder:

1. **001_Script-Template_Inputs.md** - Script structure and style preferences
2. **002_Write-a-Pre-Production-Checklist_Inputs.md** - Pre-production tasks and requirements
3. **003_Standardize-Gear-Setup_Inputs.md** - Equipment specifications and settings
4. **004_Define-a-Recording-Ritual_Inputs.md** - Recording workflow and rituals
5. **005_Set-Folder-Structure-and-Naming_Inputs.md** - File organization system
6. **006_Document-an-Editing-Workflow_Inputs.md** - Editing process steps
7. **007_Save-Presets_Inputs.md** - Software presets and standards
8. **008_Build-Thumbnail-Template-Set-with-3-Layout-Variants_Inputs.md** - Thumbnail design specs
9. **009_End-Screen-and-Card-Template_Inputs.md** - End screen elements and CTAs
10. **010_Write-a-Backup-Plan-3-2-1_Inputs.md** - Backup strategy details

## How to Use These Forms

### Step 1: Read the Prompt
First, open the corresponding prompt file in the parent folder (e.g., `001_Script-Template-Prompt_2025-11-06.txt`)

### Step 2: Document Your Current Setup
Fill out the input form with your current equipment, software, and workflows. If you don't have something established yet, use the prompt to help you create it.

### Step 3: Create Your Standards
Use your completed inputs to create reusable templates, checklists, and documentation that your entire team can follow.

### Step 4: Test and Refine
Try your documented processes on actual content. Update the forms based on what works and what doesn't.

## Best Practices

1. **Be Thorough** - Document every step, even if it seems obvious. Future you (or new team members) will thank you.

2. **Include Specifics** - Don't just say "good lighting." Specify "2x softbox lights at 45-degree angles, 5600K color temperature."

3. **Visual Documentation** - Take photos of your gear setup, screenshot your editing workflows, save examples of finished work.

4. **Version Your Processes** - As you improve, keep dated versions to track evolution.

5. **Make it Accessible** - Store completed documentation where your entire team can access it.

## Production Workflow Integration

These input forms support your entire production pipeline:

**Pre-Production** → Forms 002, 003
**Production** → Forms 001, 004
**Post-Production** → Forms 006, 007, 008, 009
**Asset Management** → Form 005, 010

## Equipment Documentation Tips

When documenting gear (Form 003):
- Include model numbers and purchase dates
- Note settings and configurations
- Photograph your setup
- Document backup equipment
- List required accessories (cables, batteries, memory cards)

## Workflow Documentation Tips

When documenting workflows (Forms 004, 006):
- Break down into clear, sequential steps
- Estimate time for each step
- Note any decision points
- Include quality checkpoints
- Document troubleshooting steps

## Template Creation Tips

When creating templates (Forms 001, 008, 009):
- Build 2-3 variations for flexibility
- Include annotated examples
- Provide file specifications (resolution, format, etc.)
- Note platform-specific adaptations
- Store master files accessibly

## Integration with Other Phases

### Phase 01: Strategy and Planning
Your production capabilities should align with your publishing cadence and content calendar.

### Phase 03: Optimization and Distribution
Production quality affects discoverability and engagement metrics.

### Phase 04: Analysis and Iteration
Track which production elements contribute to top-performing content.

## Next Steps

After completing all input forms:
1. Create master documentation for your production processes
2. Train team members on your standards
3. Create templates and presets based on your inputs
4. Set up your file organization system
5. Implement your backup plan
6. Test everything with actual content
7. Refine based on results
