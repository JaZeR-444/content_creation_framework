# 03_Optimization_and_Distribution

This phase focuses on making your content discoverable and ensuring it reaches your target audience across multiple platforms and channels.

## Overview

Optimization and Distribution contains 10 essential modules for maximizing content reach and performance:

1. **Keyword Selection per Video** - Choose optimal keywords for discoverability
2. **Title Sprint** - Generate and test high-performing titles
3. **Description Template** - Create consistent, SEO-friendly descriptions
4. **Tag List and Upload Settings** - Maintain platform-specific metadata
5. **Chapters with Action-Oriented Labels** - Improve navigation and retention
6. **Playlist Assignment** - Optimize for session watch time
7. **Thumbnail Checklist** - Ensure high click-through rates
8. **End Screens and Cards Placement** - Drive engagement at peak moments
9. **Distribution Plan Per Video** - Coordinate multi-channel promotion
10. **Repurpose Workflow** - Transform content into platform-specific assets

## How to Use This Phase

1. **Review the Master File**: Study `Optimization-and-Distribution_Master-File.md` for the complete optimization strategy
