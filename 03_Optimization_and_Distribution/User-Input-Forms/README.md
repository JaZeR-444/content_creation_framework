2. **002_Title-Sprint_Inputs.md** - Title brainstorming and testing
3. **003_Description_Template_Inputs.md** - Description structure and links
4. **004_Maintain-a-Tag-List-and-Default-Upload-Settings_Inputs.md** - Tags and platform settings

9. **009_Distribution-Plan-Per-Video_Inputs.md** - Cross-platform distribution
10. **010_Set-a-Repurpose-Workflow_Inputs.md** - Content repurposing process

## How to Use These Forms

### Step 1: Research First
Before filling out optimization forms, do your keyword research, competitor analysis, and platform research.

### Step 2: Complete for Each Video
Many of these forms (001, 002, 003, 005, 009) are completed for EACH piece of content. Create a copy for each video.

### Step 3: Build Your Standards
Some forms (004, 006, 007, 008, 010) help you create reusable processes and templates.

### Step 4: Optimize Before Publishing
Complete relevant forms before uploading content. Don't publish unoptimized content.

### Step 5: Track and Iterate
Note which optimization strategies work best, and refine your approach over time.

## Best Practices

1. **Front-Load Research** - Do keyword research and title testing before finalizing content.

2. **Be Consistent** - Use your templates and checklists for every piece of content.

3. **Test Variations** - Try different titles, thumbnails, and descriptions to see what performs best.

4. **Platform-Specific** - Adapt your optimization for each platform's unique algorithm and audience.

5. **Track Everything** - Document what works and what doesn't in your analytics (Phase 06).

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Keyword Stuffing** - Use keywords naturally, not forced
2. **Clickbait Titles** - Misleading titles hurt retention and trust
3. **Generic Descriptions** - Front-load value and keywords
4. **Ignoring Chapters** - Chapters improve discoverability and UX
5. **Weak Thumbnails** - First impression matters most
6. **Poor End Screen Timing** - Place at natural conclusion, not mid-sentence
7. **Publishing Without Optimization** - Always optimize before going live

## Next Steps

After completing all input forms:
1. Create video-specific optimization documents for upcoming content
2. Build your tag library and default settings
3. Design thumbnail templates
4. Plan your playlist structure
5. Document your repurpose workflow
6. Create distribution templates
7. Track performance in Phase 06 (Analytics)
