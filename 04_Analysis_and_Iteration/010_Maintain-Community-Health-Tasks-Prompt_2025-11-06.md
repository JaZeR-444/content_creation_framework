Step 2: Reasoning and Priority Map
- Think out loud in a <reasoning> block.
- Classify comment priority. High, medium, low. High includes questions, bug reports, misinformation, or creator mentions.
- Choose a simple daily window for triage. Example: 09:30 and 16:30 checks, America/Chicago.
- Decide poll and update cadence based on capacity.

Step 3: SLA and Inbox Flow
- State your SLA. Reply to high priority within 24 hours, medium within 48, low at discretion.
- Build the triage table and tagging rules.

Triage table
| Priority | Definition | Action | SLA | Tag |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| High | Direct question, confusion, bug, safety or legal risk | Personalized reply or escalate | 24h | P1 |
| Medium | Feedback, suggestions, constructive critique | Short reply or like, log insight | 48h | P2 |
| Low | Compliments, non actionable comments | Like, optional reply | When possible | P3 |
| Spam | Links, scams, harassment | Hide or report per policy | Immediate | SPAM |

Step 5: Periodic Channel Updates
- Post a weekly or monthly update. Keep it short and useful.
- Outline. What you shipped, what is coming next, one tip, one ask.
- Include links to playlists or resources. Respect link policy.

- What shipped. 2 to 4 bullets with links.
- Coming next. 2 bullets with dates.
- Tip of the week. One short actionable idea.
- Ask. Vote in the poll or comment your roadblock.

Step 6: Automation, Tags, and Roles

| Like rate on updates | Upward trend |
