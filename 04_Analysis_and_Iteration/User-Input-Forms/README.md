# User Input Forms - Analysis and Iteration

## Purpose

This folder contains user input forms for each of the 10 prompts in the Analysis and Iteration phase. These forms help you establish data tracking systems, performance monitoring processes, and continuous improvement workflows.

## What's Inside

Each form corresponds to a numbered prompt in the parent folder:

1. **001_Build-a-Dashboard_Inputs.md** - Analytics dashboard setup
2. **002_Review-Retention-Graphs-and-Drop-Fix-Log_Inputs.md** - Retention analysis process
3. **003_AB-Testing-Log_Inputs.md** - A/B testing framework
4. **004_Mine-Comments-Weekly-and-Tag-Questions-Objections-Wins-and-New-Ideas_Inputs.md** - Comment analysis system
5. **005_Track-a-Competitor-Watchlist_Inputs.md** - Competitor monitoring
6. **006_Set-an-Experiment-Cadence_Inputs.md** - Experimentation schedule
7. **007_Prune-or-Refresh-Underperformers-After-60-Days_Inputs.md** - Content optimization strategy

10. **010_Maintain-Community-Health-Tasks_Inputs.md** - Community management tasks

## How to Use These Forms

### Step 1: Set Up Your Systems
Forms 001-003 help you establish your analytics infrastructure. Complete these first to start collecting data.

### Step 2: Create Regular Processes
Forms 004-006, 009-010 define recurring tasks. Schedule these in your calendar and follow consistently.

### Step 3: Document Your Findings
Forms 002, 007-008 guide your analysis and action-taking. Use these to improve existing content.

### Step 4: Build a Feedback Loop
Connect insights from analysis back to Phase 01 (Strategy) and Phase 02 (Production) to continuously improve.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Early** - Begin tracking from your first piece of content. You can't analyze data you didn't collect.

2. **Be Consistent** - Set regular review schedules (weekly, monthly, quarterly) and stick to them.

3. **Focus on Actionable Metrics** - Track metrics you can actually influence and improve.

4. **Document Everything** - Keep logs of tests, changes, and results for future reference.

5. **Close the Loop** - Always connect insights to concrete actions.

## One-Time Setup Forms

Complete these forms once to establish your systems:

- **Form 001:** Dashboard Setup - Configure your analytics tracking
- **Form 003:** A/B Testing Log - Create testing framework
- **Form 005:** Competitor Watchlist - Identify competitors to monitor
- **Form 006:** Experiment Cadence - Set testing schedule

## A/B Testing Framework

Use Form 003 to test:
- Titles (compare CTR)
- Thumbnails (compare CTR)
- Publishing times (compare first-hour views)
- Video length (compare AVD)
- Content formats (compare engagement)
- Distribution strategies (compare platform performance)

**Reference:** `06_Analytics/AB-Tests.csv`

## Retention Analysis (Form 002)

Look for:
- **Sharp drops** - Identify what caused viewers to leave
- **Plateau sections** - Content is holding attention
- **Gradual decline** - Natural attention fade
- **Spikes** - Re-engagement moments

**Action:** Fix drops, replicate plateaus, study spikes.

## Comment Mining (Form 004)

Categorize comments as:
- **Questions** - Potential video topics
- **Objections** - Address in future content
- **Wins** - Testimonials and social proof
- **New Ideas** - Audience-suggested topics

**Action:** Build content calendar from audience insights.

## Content Lifecycle Management

**New Content (0-7 days):**
- Monitor initial performance
- Engage heavily with comments
- Promote actively

**Growing Content (8-60 days):**
- Track performance trends
- A/B test if performing well
- Light promotion

**Mature Content (60+ days):**
- Assess performance (Form 007)
- Refresh winners (Form 008)
- Prune or archive underperformers

## Integration with Other Phases

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Analysis Paralysis** - Don't get stuck analyzing. Take action on insights.
2. **Vanity Metrics** - Focus on metrics that drive business goals, not just big numbers.
3. **Inconsistent Tracking** - Missing data makes trend analysis impossible.
4. **No Action** - Insights without action are wasted effort.
5. **Ignoring Audience** - Comments contain goldmine insights.
6. **Short-Term Thinking** - Look for long-term trends, not just weekly fluctuations.
