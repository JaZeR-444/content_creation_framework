# B-Roll

## Purpose

This folder stores background footage and supplemental video clips used to enhance your main content. B-roll adds visual interest, illustrates concepts, and covers cuts in your primary footage.

## What to Store Here

- Generic B-roll footage (typing, working, etc.)
- Location and environment shots
- Product demonstrations and close-ups
- Screen recordings and software demos
- Transition clips
- Time-lapses and slow-motion footage
- Overlay elements and textures

## File Naming Convention

Use descriptive names with dates:
- `Office-Setup_2025-11-07.mp4`
- `Keyboard-Typing_Close-Up.mp4`
- `Product-Demo_CCF-045.mp4`
- `Screen-Recording_Software-Tutorial_2025-11-07.mp4`

## Organizing Tips

1. **Create subcategories if needed:**
   - B-Roll/Office/
   - B-Roll/Product/
   - B-Roll/Outdoor/
   - B-Roll/Screen-Recordings/

2. **Tag or label clips** with keywords for easy searching

3. **Keep high-quality source files** for future reuse

4. **Create a B-roll catalog** listing available clips

## Best Practices

- Shoot more B-roll than you think you'll need
- Keep clips short (5-15 seconds typically)
- Shoot in the same format/quality as main footage
- Include a variety of angles and perspectives
- Maintain consistent lighting and color grading

## Common Use Cases

- Covering jump cuts in dialogue
- Illustrating spoken concepts
- Establishing location or context
- Adding visual variety
- Smoothing transitions between scenes
- Creating montages
