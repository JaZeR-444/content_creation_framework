# Step 3: Content Review Process

This guide outlines the comprehensive review process for ensuring content quality, consistency, and alignment with framework standards before publication.

## Review Philosophy

The Content Creation Framework emphasizes continuous improvement through structured review processes. Quality content results from:
- **Multiple review passes** with different focuses
- **Clear quality standards** documented and measurable
- **Constructive feedback loops** that improve future content
- **Data-driven iteration** based on performance metrics

## Review Types and Timing

### 1. Pre-Production Review (Phase 01-02)
**When**: Before filming/creating content  
**Focus**: Strategy and planning  
**Estimated Time**: 15-30 minutes

### 2. Production Review (Phase 02)
**When**: During content creation  
**Focus**: Technical quality and execution  
**Estimated Time**: 10-20 minutes per check-in

### 3. Post-Production Review (Phase 02-03)
**When**: After editing, before optimization  
**Focus**: Content quality and polish  
**Estimated Time**: 30-60 minutes

### 4. Pre-Launch Review (Phase 03)
**When**: After optimization, before publishing  
**Focus**: Metadata, SEO, and distribution readiness  
**Estimated Time**: 15-30 minutes

### 5. Post-Launch Review (Phase 04)
**When**: 24-72 hours after publishing  
**Focus**: Performance and audience response  
**Estimated Time**: 20-40 minutes

### 6. Retrospective Review (Phase 04)
**When**: 30-60 days after publishing  
**Focus**: Long-term performance and learnings  
**Estimated Time**: 30-60 minutes
